# euler_84

A version of the classic "snake"-style game for TI-84 written in TI-BASIC. For when you're done with the test early and don't have access to your phone.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to use this utility on a physical TI-84 or an emulator with a TI-84 ROM image loaded. The one referenced in this ReadMe is **jsTIfied**, an online graphing calculator emulator that can be found at [Cemetech.net](https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/).

### Prerequisites

#### Calculator

* [TI Connect™ Software](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/B59F6C83468C4574ABFEE93D2BC3F807/swticonnectsoftware) - Software for sending the program to the calculator

* [USB Mini B Cable](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71570Bmv81L._SX355_.jpg) - Cable connecting the calculator to the computer

#### jstTIfied Emulator

* [TI-84 ROM Image](https://www.ticalc.org/programming/emulators/romdump.html) - A ROM image needs to be loaded onto the emulator for it to work

## Installation

Use TI Connect™ to send the `ZNAKE.8xp` file to your calculator. You can also read the code in the `raw.txt` file of the repository and manually write it on your calculator if you're familiar with TI-BASIC.

## Usage

**1.)** Run the program `ZNAKE` in the programs menu.

**2.)** Start by hitting one of the movement controls (arrow keys).
  * If you've never played a snake-like game, you can find information on it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) (though I don't see why you'd want it in the first place if you didn't know anything about it).
  
**3.)** At game over, press `Enter` and wait to be prompted to either play again or exit.

## Built With

* [TI-84 Plus](https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-84-plus) - Calculator used to make the program
* [TI Connect™ Software](https://education.ti.com/en/software/details/en/B59F6C83468C4574ABFEE93D2BC3F807/swticonnectsoftware) - Used to export the program from the calculator to the computer in .8xp format
* [Source Coder 3 (Cemetech.net)](https://www.cemetech.net/sc/) - Simplifies debugging process
